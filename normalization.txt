I put my tables in fourth normal form, because there is no multi value dependency for example, each Manager_ID  has its own unique values, they are not dependent on each other, each attribute is independent of itself. The number of hours an Employee works is not dependent on the Manager_ID. Each table has multiple attributes but in a way where it is not redundant and has no multi value dependency. This is the most effective way to stay away from data redundancy.
